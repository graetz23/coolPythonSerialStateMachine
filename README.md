## cool Python Serial State Machine

### Introduction
State machine for sending to and receiving from ardunio commands via serial console.

### Remarks
**The project is NOT FINISHED; and on going**

I have written an [arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) library as the _mirrow_ project: [coolASSM](https://github.com/graetz23/coolArduinoSerialStateMachine), where arduino is acting as a server for driving or / and processing sensor / actor / .. data and sending it.

Everything was coded using:

  - [**atom**](https://atom.io/) editor,
  - [**Gnome**](https://www.gnome.org/) as window manager,
  - and [**debian**](https://www.debian.org/) GNU/Linux.

## ChangeLog

**version 20200401**:
  - created repository [coolPythonSerialStateMachine](https://github.com/graetz23/coolPythonSerialStateMachine.git) on github.
